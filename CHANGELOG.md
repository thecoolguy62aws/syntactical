# Changelog

This changelog was started at version `1.3.1` and will have all versions after that version. Some earlier versions may be included.

### 1.4.0
**NOTE**: This release *should* have been called 2.0.0 because it's not backwards compatible. But, no one uses this language yet so it doesn't really matter (and I don't want to go to version 2 this early)
- Change `use` keyword to `import` as it's more accurate about what it does.

### 1.3.3
- Make dependancies more robust

### 1.3.2

- Add egg info to gitignore
- Add publish script to gitignore
- Add PyPi description
- Add changelog

# Changelog

This changelog was started at version `1.3.1` and will have all versions after that version. Some earlier versions may be included.

## 2.0.0

## 1.6.1

- Fix issue [#2](https://github.com/thecoolguy62aws/syntactical/issues/2)

## 1.6.0

## 1.5.3

## 1.5.1

- Add `exit()` and `stop()` as aliases of Python `exit()`.

## 1.5.0

## 1.4.1

- Add error message easter egg. Only one way to find out what this is!

## 1.4.0

**NOTE**: This release *should* have been called 2.0.0 because it's not backwards compatible. But, no one uses this language yet so it doesn't really matter (and I don't want to go to version 2 this early)
- Change `use` keyword to `import` as it's more accurate about what it does.

- Make dependancies more robust

## 1.3.2

# Syntactical

**_The programing language of the future._**

### What is Syntactical?

Syntactical is not *really* a programming language; it's a transpiler. It transpiles this "pretend" langauge to python, then runs it.

### Modules

Syntactical doesn't have its own modules, instead it uses Python's vast supply of modules. Syntactical doesn't support multifile because it can only import Python modules. By installing a module with Python's pip, you can import it to your Syntactical program and use it like you would in Python (except with `use` instead of `import`).
